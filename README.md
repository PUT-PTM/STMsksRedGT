# sksRedGT

sksRedGT is a smartphone controlled toy car mostly powered by batteries. 
Car sksRedGT is also faithful copy of the original Alfa Romeo 6969, which didn't actually exist.
(I just make up to fill description cuz one paragraph would look poor; in english every word feels like a shooting star. Make a wish!)
